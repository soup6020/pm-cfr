# The failsafe has been added to prevent servers from executing as set amount of punishments every second
# PunishmentalReborn will reset if the server tries to execute more punishments per second than is defined in the Trigger
# value below.
# PunishmentalReborn can also restart if the server lags a certain amount of milliseconds. To disable this, set LagMargin below to 0.
# Otherwise, set it to the amount of milliseconds lag you deem acceptable before punishmentalreborn should shut off.
